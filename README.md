# EarthQuakeMap
DISCLAIMER!
I don't expect of full authorship of this project, this is a part of studying job 
on the course https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance
I only done it, then rewrite and add some my own features.

This project reads rss file from the website that registered earthequakes all over the world
and show they on the map using UnfoldingMaps and Processing 2.0.
